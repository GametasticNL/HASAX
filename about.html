  <h1>About HASAX</h1>
  <p>Caps aren't just a form of headwear.
Caps tell stories. Stories about us.

Our story started in Den Bosch. Living in the Netherlands, we noticed that caps and hats are becoming more and more about telling a story. A story about the person behind the cap or hat. With this in mind, we started HASAX. A cap and hat webshop where people can find caps and hats, which resemble their story. We try to find and design caps, which relate to the culture of the urban lifestyle. Of course we'd love to hear and see about your story.

Caps. Because we all have a story to tell.</p>

        <p>I am currently studying in 's-Hertogenbosch at the Pierson College. I'm in Havo 4 and
am very eager to learn. This year I chose the Nature & Technology combined profile
meet Nature & Health.
I am a go-getter, never give up and I am a curious person. I can fast
make decisions when necessary.</p>

        <p>I have been actively involved in technology since my primary school days. I have designed a lot and I was always busy making other people's stuff. For example, I made lamps out of wood for our house. During my high school I also found out that I am good with maths and calculations. I am also the designer of Hasax</p>
